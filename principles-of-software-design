DRY - Don't repeat yourself
   Single source of truth.
   Every data field with unique name. [TABLENAME_FIELDNAME, FK=PK, JOIN_TABLE:PK={TABLENAME_ID,TABLENAME2_ID,TYPE_JOIN,INDEX}]
   Every data record with unique EVENT_ID, TRANSACTION_ID, TIMESTAMP, STATUS, [OWNER, GROUP, PERMISSIONS [Like Linux]]
KISS - Keep it simple
   Use it or lose it.
CQRS - Command Query Responsibility Segregation
   Queries: Return a result and do not change the observable state of the system (are free of side effects).
   Commands: Change the state of a system but do not return a value.
USER STORY MAPPING - workflows, names of functions and data structures

- global settings, logging and users with groups/roles
- group similar functionality, functions and data in modules and classes
- don't expose data, expose behavior
- one function - make only one thing [high Cohesion, loose Coupling]

Function
- pure functions [deterministic, no side effects], immutable data [result is only return data]
- command - do not return a value, only Error Code [like C, BASH]
1. five lines of code
2. pass or call
3. only one IF without else
   exception: function to handle ENUM [e.g. return a sub function/sub class for this enum]
   example: move = handleKeyToMove(key): if enum.LEFT return moveLeft
            move(5)
